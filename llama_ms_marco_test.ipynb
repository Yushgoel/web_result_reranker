      "Here are possible passages:\n",
      "1) The Progressive Era spanned the years from 1890 to 1920 when the United States was experiencing rapid growth. Immigrants from eastern and southern Europe arrived in droves. Cities were overcrowded, and those living in poverty suffered greatly.\n",

      "8) As a result, the concept of reform took place in society. Reformers such as social workers, journalists, educators and even politicians emerged to change society. This was known as the Progressive Movement. One issue was consistently ignored: the plight of African-Americans in the United States. African-Americans were faced with consistent racism in the form of segregation in public spaces and disenfranchisement from the political process.\n",
      "9) The ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, which recognized women's suffrage was last amendment during the progressive era. Another significant constitutional change that began during the progressive era was the incorporation of the Bill of Rights so that those rights would apply to the states.\n",

      "Here are possible passages:\n",
      "1) The Progressive Era spanned the years from 1890 to 1920 when the United States was experiencing rapid growth. Immigrants from eastern and southern Europe arrived in droves. Cities were overcrowded, and those living in poverty suffered greatly.\n",
      "2) 1 W.E.B Du Bois was the founder of the Niagara Movement and later the NAACP, Du Bois disagreed with Washington. 2  Ida B. Wells was a journalist who wrote about the horrors of lynching in the South.\n",
      "3) 1 W.E.B Du Bois was the founder of the Niagara Movement and later the NAACP, Du Bois disagreed with Washington. He argued that African-Americans should consistently fight for racial equality. 2  Ida B. Wells was a journalist who wrote about the horrors of lynching in the South.\n",
      "4) The Progressive ideology espoused by many of the era attempted to correct societal problems created by racial integration following the Civil War by segregating the races and allowing each group to achieve its own potential.\n",
      "5) Lastly, the work of Washington, Du Bois, Wells, Terrell and countless others ultimately led to the protests of the Civil Rights Movement sixty years later. 1  5 African-American Organizations Established During the Progressive Era. 2  The Unforgettable Jim Crow Era. 3  4 Important Men and Women of the Progressive Era.\n",
      "6) Progressive Era. 1  Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, 1901–09 (left), William Howard Taft, 1909–13 (center), and Woodrow Wilson, 1913–21 (right) were the main Progressive presidents; their administrations saw intense social and political change in American society.\n",
      "7) Progressive Era. The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s.[1] The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government.\n",
      "8) As a result, the concept of reform took place in society. Reformers such as social workers, journalists, educators and even politicians emerged to change society. This was known as the Progressive Movement. One issue was consistently ignored: the plight of African-Americans in the United States. African-Americans were faced with consistent racism in the form of segregation in public spaces and disenfranchisement from the political process.\n",
      "9) The ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, which recognized women's suffrage was last amendment during the progressive era. Another significant constitutional change that began during the progressive era was the incorporation of the Bill of Rights so that those rights would apply to the states.\n",
      "10) Progressive Era. The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government. The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office a further means of direct democracy would be established.

Expect your shifts to include days, evenings, overnights, weekends, and holidays. 2  Many people find investigating the aftermath of violent crimes upsetting. 3  You may have to work overtime or be on-call to collect evidence.\n",
      "4) Some decide that forensic science is not for them, particularly after the experience of the courtroom training sessions, and successfully find employment in industrial analytical and research laboratories or study for higher degrees.\n",
      "5) Forensic Scientists do not attend crime scenes (except for firearms examiners, who are often also police officers do attend scenes as do members of the lab who analyze explosives and clandestine labs) but receive the evidence from the Ident officers and then analyze the evidence and submit a report giving their opinion of the weight of the evidence.\n",
      "6) In laboratories, a forensic science technician will typically do the following: Identify and classify crime scene evidence through scientific analysis Explore possible links between suspects and criminal activity using the results of chemical and physical analyses\n",
      "7) A:In order to become a forensic scientist, you will need an education in forensic sciences. If you are just looking for an entry level in the criminal justice sector, you can go for a 6 month certificate or diploma. A 4 year bachelor's degree can also get you entry-level positions with forensic departments.\n",
      "8) Why is forensic science important. Rapid growth of poverty, economic recession of global economy, and the unjust behavior of humanity have become the contributing factors that led to increasing criminal activities. These have triggered to the continuous waste of lives of innocent people and this is where the discipline of forensic science comes in.\n",
      "9) Some forensic scientists perform a wide array of lab work. Other forensic scientists specialize in certain aspects of crimes. There are a couple of required skills that all forensic scientists need. A forensic scientist must have good communication skills for writing reports that will be read by other scientists and laymen. Many of these scientists are called on to give expert witness testimony or present evidence in court and need good public speaking skills.\n",

Those seen hunting during the day are probably starving. Q: Where do the owls go to hunt at night? A: In most cases, these birds travel 1 to 2 miles from the daytime roost site to hunt. They hunt in roadside ditches, grassy fields, meadows, and swampy areas away from buildings. Q: How many voles does an owlet eat each night? A: For the first two weeks of age they eat from 2 to 4 per night. At three to five weeks of age they will consume 5 to 10 per night, per owlet!\n",
      "2) Owls are carnivorous and will eat rodents, small or medium sized mammals, nocturnal insects, fish and other birds, including smaller owls. After digesting their food, owls regurgitate hard pellets of compressed bones, fur, teeth, feathers and other materials they couldn't digest.\n",
      "3) It was the day Knapp Forest Elementary first-graders knew was coming: the day teacher Lana Tran would have them put on their scientist caps -- in this case, in the homemade form of birds -- and dissect owl pellets.

      "4) Quick Answer. Snowy owls eat mammals, such as rabbits and rodents, and other birds. The snowy owl swallows its prey whole when it eats and hunts during the day. Snowy owls are nomadic, meaning that they follow their prey and choose living locations based on the movement of the prey.\n",
      "5) Owls do not build nests; rather they just take over abandoned nests. While they usually lay between 3-4 eggs, a female owl can lay up to 13 eggs in the breeding season, depending on the species. Incubation will last 30 days after which the chicks hatch.\n",
      "6) Like most owls, the barn owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in complete darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another.\n",
      "7) Q: If I put up a nest box and Barn Owls use it, should I look in periodically to count eggs and such? A: If you do, make sure both adults are not in the box. If you disturb an adult with young during the day, they may harm the owlets. If you plan to count eggs or young at a nest site, wait in a secluded and quiet area within view of the box or nest site until you see both adults leave the nest for nightly hunting.\n",

      "2) Quick Answer. Lightning strikes reach the ground on Earth as much as 8 million times per day or 100 times per second, according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory. Out of all the lightning strikes in the world, the United States accounts for about 20 million of the total number of lightning strikes each year. Keep Learning.\n",
      "3) An average lightning strike discharges about 30,000 amperes (20,000 amperes in the UK). The current in a lightning strike typically ranges from 5,000 to 50,000 amperes depending on the strength of storm. NASA has recorded strikes of 100,000 amperes and there are other reports of strikes over 200,000 amperes.\n",

      "5) Lightning is a sudden high-voltage discharge of electricity that occurs within a cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Globally, there are about 40 to 50 flashes of lightning every second, or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year.\n",
      "6) Although many lightning flashes are simply cloud-to-cloud, there are as many as 9,000,000 reported lightning strikes that damage buildings, trees, and other objects every year. Worldwide, it is estimated that of an annual 1.4 billion lightning bolts, 25% (more than 350 million) will strike the Earth's surface or objects on the surface. The vast majority of these strikes, however, occur in the tropics, and in unpopulated areas. 100 times per second; Lightning can strike over a thousand times in one storm. So, lightning strikes the earth over a million times a day. Globally, 8,640,000 lightning strikes per day.\n",
      "7) According to the NWS Storm Data, over the last 30 years (1986-2015) the U.S. has averaged 48 reported lightning fatalities per year. Only about 10% of people who are struck by lightning are killed, leaving 90% with various degrees of disability. More recently, in the last 10 years (2006-2015), the U.S. has averaged 31 lightning fatalities.\n",
      "8) Approximately 300,000 lightning strikes hit the ground in Britain each year with 30 percent of reported lightning strikes causing severe damage. Each year 30 to 60 people are recorded as being struck by lightning, 3 of whom, on average, die (14 in 1984 compared to 2 in 2005).\n",
      "9) Florida is also the state with the highest number of deaths from lightning strikes. Other states along the Gulf of Mexico coast, such as Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, also have frequent lightning. Along the Atlantic coast, North Carolina and South Carolina have frequent lightning.\n",
      "10) There is estimated to be around 2,000 lightning storm active around the global at one time creating over 100 strikes per second.

      "Here are possible passages:\n",
      "1) Verify the reason for the lawn burn. Grass will turn yellow due to an over application of high nitrogen fertilizer. The lawn will also turn yellow when it goes dormant in the fall. Rake the lawn to remove as much dead grass as possible. Remove several inches of soil if the herbicide was not a high nitrogen type.\n",
      "2) These spots are generally caused by a buildup of nitrogen in the soil. Although nitrogen is required to make the lawn green, a lawn burn is a case of too much of a good thing. The nitrogen buildup may be caused by over-fertilizing your lawn, or it may be caused by urine deposits left by pets. No matter what the source of nitrogen burn marks, fixing the discolored lawn is relatively easy.\n",
      "3) Position the sprinkler over the portion of overfertilized lawn. Turn on the sprinkler and allow it to run until the soil below the grass becomes fully saturated. Allow the water to drain down through the soil, carrying the excess fertilizer with it. Apply 1 inch of water per day for the next seven days.\n",
      "4) When fertilizing start with a dry lawn. Using either a broadcast or drop spreader, apply one-half of the recommended amount in one direction then spread the remaining half at right angles to the first. After fertilizing, it is necessary to water your lawn to wash the material off the grass and into the soil.\n",
      "5) Fertilizing Tips. Watering and mowing alone will not make a healthy lawn. It must be fertilized. We have included a starter fertilizer in the mixture applied, but it is only sufficient to supply enough nutrients for about 30 to 45 days. It is important for the development of a healthy lawn that a fertilization program be started at this time.\n",
      "6) A yellow burned lawn is an eye sore that can only be fixed by reseeding all affected areas. The process of reseeding is time consuming but will be worth it once the lawn is in full vigor. The entire lawn does not have to be replaced if the burn is isolated to small areas. Simply remove only the damaged lawn and reseed.\n",
      "7) Grass1950, the amount of fertilizer you would lose to outgassing in dry conditions is very small. If you don't water, the dew that forms overnight will dissolve some of the fertilizer and increase your chances for burn, especially with the amount the OP put down. I hope everything thing turns out OK for the OP, but to lessen the odds of damaging her lawn it would be much better to water in what was put down.\n",
      "8) Rake up the dead grass blades in the fertilizer-burned areas. Remove the top 2 to 3 inches of soil in the cleared area with a shovel. Place the dead grass and soil in a wheelbarrow. Transport the removed material to a compost pile or trash bin and discard it.\n",
      "9) Fertilizer burn is the result of over fertilizing plants or applying fertilizer to wet foliage. Fertilizer contains salts, which draw moisture out of plants. When you apply excess fertilizer to plants, the result is yellow or brown discoloration and root damage.\n",
      "10) Preventing Fertilizer Burn. The good news is that fertilizer burn can be prevented. Here are some tips on preventing fertilizer burn on plants: Fertilize each plant according to its needs. You won’t get better results when you use more fertilizer and you run the risk of damaging or killing your plants.\n",

      "Here is a query: can you burn your lawn with fertilizer\n",
      "Here are possible passages:\n",
      "1) Verify the reason for the lawn burn. Grass will turn yellow due to an over application of high nitrogen fertilizer. The lawn will also turn yellow when it goes dormant in the fall. Rake the lawn to remove as much dead grass as possible. Remove several inches of soil if the herbicide was not a high nitrogen type.\n",
      "2) These spots are generally caused by a buildup of nitrogen in the soil. Although nitrogen is required to make the lawn green, a lawn burn is a case of too much of a good thing. The nitrogen buildup may be caused by over-fertilizing your lawn, or it may be caused by urine deposits left by pets. No matter what the source of nitrogen burn marks, fixing the discolored lawn is relatively easy.\n",
      "3) Position the sprinkler over the portion of overfertilized lawn. Turn on the sprinkler and allow it to run until the soil below the grass becomes fully saturated. Allow the water to drain down through the soil, carrying the excess fertilizer with it. Apply 1 inch of water per day for the next seven days.\n",
      "4) When fertilizing start with a dry lawn. Using either a broadcast or drop spreader, apply one-half of the recommended amount in one direction then spread the remaining half at right angles to the first. After fertilizing, it is necessary to water your lawn to wash the material off the grass and into the soil.\n",
      "5) Fertilizing Tips. Watering and mowing alone will not make a healthy lawn. It must be fertilized. We have included a starter fertilizer in the mixture applied, but it is only sufficient to supply enough nutrients for about 30 to 45 days. It is important for the development of a healthy lawn that a fertilization program be started at this time.\n",
      "6) A yellow burned lawn is an eye sore that can only be fixed by reseeding all affected areas. The process of reseeding is time consuming but will be worth it once the lawn is in full vigor. The entire lawn does not have to be replaced if the burn is isolated to small areas. Simply remove only the damaged lawn and reseed.\n",
      "7) Grass1950, the amount of fertilizer you would lose to outgassing in dry conditions is very small. If you don't water, the dew that forms overnight will dissolve some of the fertilizer and increase your chances for burn, especially with the amount the OP put down. I hope everything thing turns out OK for the OP, but to lessen the odds of damaging her lawn it would be much better to water in what was put down.\n",
      "8) Rake up the dead grass blades in the fertilizer-burned areas. Remove the top 2 to 3 inches of soil in the cleared area with a shovel. Place the dead grass and soil in a wheelbarrow. Transport the removed material to a compost pile or trash bin and discard it.\n",
      "9) Fertilizer burn is the result of over fertilizing plants or applying fertilizer to wet foliage. Fertilizer contains salts, which draw moisture out of plants. When you apply excess fertilizer to plants, the result is yellow or brown discoloration and root damage.\n",
      "10) Preventing Fertilizer Burn. The good news is that fertilizer burn can be prevented. Here are some tips on preventing fertilizer burn on plants: Fertilize each plant according to its needs. You won’t get better results when you use more fertilizer and you run the risk of damaging or killing your plants.\n",

It is a multicellular or unicellular  organism. Organisms that are consumers or decomposers are  heterotrophs. A parasite is also a heterotroph. A parasite feeds  off other organisms for its food. An example of a parasite is a  deet tick. An example of a decomposing heterotroph is an earthworm.\n",

      "7) Nutrition in Autotrophic Organisms. In this, organisms synthesize the essential organic compounds from inorganic compounds like carbon dioxide and water in the presence of radiant energy of sunlight trapped by magnesium ions (Mg 2+) containing green pigment, chlorophyll. The process is called photosynthesis.\n",
      "8) Some non green bacteria manufacture their organic food from inorganic substances in the presence of energy derived from the oxidation of simple inorganic compounds of sulphur and iron etc. For example sulphur and iron bacteria. This process is called chemosynthesis. And organisms are called chemoautotroph.\n",
      "9) This is characteristic of all animals and fungi, some protists (for example Trypanosona, Paramecium, Amoeba), many bacteria, (for example pseudomonas) and some non green plants (for example Parasitic plants like cuscuta) they take readymade organic food from other dead or living plants and animals.\n",
      "10) Thus plants are autotrophic orgainsms because they synthesize their own food themselves. There are organisms like animals that are not capable of making their food from sunlight and carbon dioxide and water. Animals get their food from plants and other animals. They are called heterotrophic organisms.\n",

      "['However, drops up to 10 mm (equivalent in volume to a sphere of radius 4.5 mm) are theoretically stable and could be levitated in a wind tunnel. The largest recorded raindrop was 8.8 mm in diameter, located at the base of a cumulus congestus cloud in the vicinity of Kwajalein Atoll in July 1999.', 'A droplet with a diameter of 3 mm has a terminal velocity of approximately 8 m/s. Drops smaller than 1 mm in diameter will attain 95% of their terminal velocity within 2 m. But above this size the distance to get to terminal velocity increases sharply. An example is a drop with a diameter of 2 mm that may achieve this at 5.6 m.', 'A raindrop may have a maximum diameter of 0.25 centimeter.. 2.5 mm. Rain.. Encyclopedia Encarta .1st ed. CD-ROM. New York: Microsoft, 2000. Raindrops generally have a diameter greater than 0.5 mm (0.02 in.).', \"Close enough to the earth to encounter air resistance, this acceleration is 9.8 meters per second squared, or 32 feet per second squared. 3. Calculate the downward pull of gravity. The force with which the falling object is being pulled down equals the object's mass times acceleration due to gravity, or F = MA. This number, multiplied by two, goes in the top of the terminal velocity formula.\", '4. Figure out the drag force that is opposing the downward pull of gravity. If you know the velocity of the object, but not the drag force, you can use the formula to calculate the drag force. This is (C*ρ*A*(v^2))/2.', 'The mass m of the drop hanging from the end of the tube can be found by equating the force due to gravity () with the component of the surface tension in the vertical direction () giving the formula. where α is the angle of contact with the tube, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.', 'Use the terminal velocity formula, v = the square root of ((2*m*g)/(ρ*A*C)). Plug the following values into that formula to solve for v, terminal velocity. 1  m = mass of the falling object. 2  g = the acceleration due to gravity.', 'Raindrop sizes typically range from 0.5 mm to 4 mm, with size distributions quickly decreasing past diameters larger than 2-2.5 mm. Scientists traditionally thought that the variation in the size of raindrops was due to collisions on the way down to the ground.', 'In fact, they are actually oblate spheroids, or spheres with the nose smashed in. Different sources approximate different ranges for the measure of a diameter of a raindrop. However, on the average, a raindrop is between 0.1 to 5 millimeters. There are some exceptions; rarely, raindrops of 8 millimeters were known to occur. Sizes larger than that do not normally occur because the raindrop particles simply break up or collide with other neighboring particles.', 'By suspending drops of known size, he determined that small drops up to about 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter fell as spheres. Larger drops, however, deformed while falling acquiring a shape with a flat bottom and rounded top similar to that of a hamburger bun.']\n",
